# odin-recipes
A simple website for cooking recipes.
As a part of The Odin Project curriculum, I am going to build a simple website using the HTML knowledge that I have gained in previous lessons, based on cooking recipes.

The aim of this project is to reinforce the knowledge that was previously gained, and to show my own HTML basics skills.
