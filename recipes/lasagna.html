    <h2>Homemade Lasagna</h2>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce 
            and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with 
            ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
            I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
        <p>Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems. Don't be intimidated by all the layers of 
            delicious Italian flavor â€” try this homemade lasagna recipe today!</p>

                    and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong> Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour.
