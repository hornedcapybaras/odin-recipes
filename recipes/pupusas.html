    <img src="img/pupusas.jpg">
    <h2 class="titles">Pupusas</h2>
        <p>A popular food in El Salvador. A thick corn tortilla filled with cheese and easy to customize. 
            Serve topped with curtido (pickled cabbage) or eat them plain. My ex-boyfriend's Salvadorean 
            mother's recipe!</p>
    <h3 class="titles">Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For the curtido</h4>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>2 cups shredded green cabbage</li>
            <li>½ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>½ cup water, or more as needed</li>
            <li>½ onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 carrot, grated</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground oregano</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the pupusa dough</h4>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>3 cups masa harina flour (Mexican corn masa mix)</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups water, or more as needed</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the pupusa filling</h4>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 scallion, finely chopped, or more to taste</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="titles">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add cabbage and cook uncovered until 
                slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water 
                for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain. </li>
            <li>Mix cabbage, apple cider vinegar, water, onion, carrot, oregano, red pepper flakes, 
                and 1 pinch salt together in a large bowl. Refrigerate until flavors combine, 
                8 hours to overnight. </li>
            <li>Combine masa harina, water, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl; knead until 
                a smooth, moist dough forms. Add water if dough cracks when you press down on it. 
                Let dough rest, 5 to 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Stir ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, heavy cream, and scallion together in a bowl to make 
                a paste.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 8 balls. Press your thumb into the center of each ball to form an 
                indentation. Fill indentations with ricotta cheese paste. Pinch edges together around the 
                filling; flatten and smooth into round 1/4 inch-thick patties between your palms. </li>
            <li>Grease a skillet with cooking spray; preheat over medium heat. Cook pupusas in batches 
                until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. </li>
            <li>Drain cabbage mixture and serve alongside pupusas.</li>
